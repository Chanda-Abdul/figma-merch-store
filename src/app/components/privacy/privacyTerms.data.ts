Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account.The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and(iii) set forth the specific relief sought.Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within thirty(30) days from the date the Notice is sent.After that thirty(30) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration.',
